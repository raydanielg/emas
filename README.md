# eMAS â€” Examination Marking and Results System

eMAS is a focused system for supervising and semi-automating examination marking, and simplifying results compilation and publication. It aims to make the workflow fast, transparent, and maintainable.

- Built with Laravel and modern, minimal UI (Tailwind CSS).
- Development environment is pre-configured for local use.
- Clear structure for extending modules (marking, moderation, reports, exports).

> Note: This repository is prepared for development use. Production hardening (SSO, rate limiting, audit logs, etc.) is intentionally out of scope for now.

## Login credential
 > enteres of data logins:
    username: demo@test.com
    password: Password123!
> Headmaster logins 
   username: headmaster1
   password: Pass@123

## Getting Started (Development)

1. Requirements: PHP 8.2+, Composer, SQLite/MySQL (optional), Git.
2. Install dependencies:
   - `composer install`
3. Environment:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust `APP_URL`, database creds if needed.
   - Generate key: `php artisan key:generate`.
4. Run locally:
   - `php artisan serve` (or) `php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t public/`.
5. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/login

## Current Scope

- UI: Custom sign-in and forgot-password pages (Tailwind).
- Auth (UI only for now): username + password forms; backend wiring pending.
- Branding: eMAS logo + SVG favicon.

## Roadmap (High-level)

- Authentication backed by database (username login).
- Roles/permissions for markers, reviewers, and admins.
- Marking workflows and moderation.
- Results verification, exports, and dashboards.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
